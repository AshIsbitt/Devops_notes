### DevOps
Devops is the combination of Development and Operations teams, a newer paradigm within the IT industry. It allows for the improvement of collaboration and productivity by **automating infrastructure**, **automating workflows**, and continuously **measuring application performance**

**Automation**

- Automate code testing
- Automate workflows
- Automate infrastructure
- Automate everything

Software is written in small chunks that integrate together and can be deployed to the "live" version of the code in hours, as opposed to in weeks.

This results in the Dev environment and the live Production environment to be identical, resulting in easier deployment. An iterative approach can be taken on developing and deploying code, resulting in higher quality code and quicker reactions to various elements.

Constant apploation monitoring in realtime allowing for quicker reactions to the new features etc.

#### Benefits

- Faster releases
- Better business focus, less time wasted on maintenance

Changes in the mindset are required
New tools will be required.

#### Tools
- Something that allows for continuous testing and building of the code (IE Jenkins)
- Source control (Github)
- Configuration Management of servers (Chef)
- Software/environment logs and monitoring (New Relic)
